# pygeodb

This python module provides a class and methods for adding, updating, and reading data from a SQLite database. It is geared towards a database of geochemical measurements on geologic materials, but it will be as general as possible with respect to admit a variety of data sources.

Package documentation and source is available at https://github.com/sarttiso/pygeodb.
